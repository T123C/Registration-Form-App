# Registration-Form-App

Written in Kotlin to simulate a registration app. 

The Main activity consists of a standard registration form to fill out, using Spinner for a title drop-down menu and inputType for a better UX. 
'CREATE ACCOUNT' button takes user to the Summary activity, where they can see the summary of the data inputted, excluding password.
Data class and Serialization are used to pass the data from Main to Summary activities. Summary activity phone number and email are clickable, and will take the user
to phone number pad or Gmail app respectively.
